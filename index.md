## Hi there!

I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the Language Development Department at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. I study the development and processing of semantic representations. How do children learn to piece together the meanings of individual words in the interpretation of sentence? How are such meanings represented in our minds? I am also interested in the semantics-syntax interface, (experimental) pragmatics, and bilingual language processing. I have also studied how we can use web-based methods to conduct psycholinguistic experiments (like web-based eye-tracking).

Before coming to the Max Planck Institute, I obtained my PhD degree at the Department of Experimental Psychology at Ghent University  (Belgium) under the supervision of Professor Robert J. Hartsuiker and Professor Peter Lauwers. See my thesis [here](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8771073/file/8771111). I earnt my master's degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge (UK) and my bachelor's degree in Dutch Language and Culture (specialisation in Linguistics) at the University of Groningen (NL).
